# Weather App
This is a digital weather app built using vanilla JavaScript. It allows users to check the current weather and forecast for their location, or any location of their choice. The app utilizes the **OpenWeatherMap API** to retrieve the weather data. The user interface is simple, clean and easy to use. You can check the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure for the current location, as well as a forecast for the next 5 days. Feel free to use and contribute to this project. You can view the live demo of the application [here](https://weather-app-eight-xi-73.vercel.app)
